I am bemused why mkfile doesn't really come recommended – Alex Mills May 11 '15 at 19:48

Depending on what you want the file to contain:

touch /path/to/file for an empty file
somecommand > /path/to/file for a file containing the output of some command.

  eg: grep --help > randomtext.txt
      echo "This is some text" > randomtext.txt
nano /path/to/file or vi /path/to/file (or any other editor emacs,gedit etc)
It either opens the existing one for editing or creates & opens the empty file to enter, if it doesn't exist

also, printf "some long message\nwith newlines\n" > file . Good luck to all. – shellter Feb 21 '12 at 16:50

UNIX is not a command line environment, but a family of (very different) OSes. That said: Yes, this should work on most Unices – Eugen Rieck Feb 21 '12 at 16:58

touch will work in UNIX, because it's a standard tool. The somecommand example will work because it uses standard syntax. The nano sample may not work because an editor named nano may not be installed (nano is not standardized). The standard editor is ed and could be used in place of nano, or you could use $EDITOR to use your user- or system-configured default text editor, if there is one. – Sorpigal Feb 21 '12 at 17:16

Additionally, you could simply say >/path/to/file to create an empty file, even if you don't have touch. – Sorpigal Feb 21 '12 at 17:17

Create the file using cat

$ cat > myfile.txt

Now, just type whatever you want in the file:

Hello World!

CTRL-D to save and exit

There are several possible solutions:

Create an empty file
touch file

>file

echo -n > file

printf '' > file
The echo version will work only if your version of echo supports the -n switch to suppress newlines. This is a non-standard addition. The other examples will all work in a POSIX shell.

Create a file containing a newline and nothing else
echo '' > file

printf '\n' > file
This is a valid "text file" because it ends in a newline.

Write text into a file
"$EDITOR" file

echo 'text' > file

cat > file <<END \
text
END

printf 'text\n' > file
These are equivalent. The $EDITOR command assumes that you have an interactive text editor defined in the EDITOR environment variable and that you interactively enter equivalent text. The cat version presumes a literal newline after the \ and after each other line. Other than that these will all work in a POSIX shell.

Of course there are many other methods of writing and creating files, too.

You can use the touch command to create a new empty file.

How to create a text file on Linux:

Using touch to create a text file: $ touch NewFile.txt
Using cat to create a new file: $ cat NewFile.txt
The file is created, but it's empty and still waiting for the input from the user. You can type any text into the terminal, and once done CTRL-D will close it, or CTRL-C will escape you out.
Simply using > to create a text file: $ > NewFile.txt
Lastly, we can use any text editor name and then create the file, such as:
nano MyNewFile 
 vi MyNewFile 
 NameOfTheEditor NewFileName

In case you guys are trying to create a new file, but it says: 'File does not exist', it's simply because you are also accessing a directory, which does not exist yet. You have to create all non existent directories first, using the mkdir /path/to/dir command.

You can use touch command, as the others said:

touch filename
To write on file on command line, you can use echo or printf:

echo "Foo" > filename
printf "Foo" > filename
Maybe you can have problems with permissions. If you are getting the following error: bash: filename: Permission denied, you need to use sudo bash -c 'echo "Foo" > filename', as described here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/103643/cannot-echo-hello-x-txt-even-with-sudo
